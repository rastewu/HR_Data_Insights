### Project Overview
This project aims to unlock actionable insights from an HR dataset through comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques. Utilizing a dataset that encompasses a wide range of employee attributes, including demographics, job roles, performance metrics, and attrition rates, the analysis seeks to identify patterns and correlations that influence employee satisfaction, engagement, and retention. The insights generated from this project are intended to support HR strategies and decision-making processes, enhancing workforce management and organizational effectiveness.

### Data Sources
This analysis comprises a dataset related to the HR Department of a ficticious company:[Link to Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-1Ldoe-DwZTL77tdMtRgZAIzeAzs0jh3/edit#gid=2089618187)

### Tools
- Excel - Data Cleaning
- Tableau Desktop 2024.1 - For creating interactive data visualizations.
- Tableau Public- For publishing and sharing dashboards online.


### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the HR Dataset dataset to answer key questions, such as:
- Department wise Attrition - Shows Attrition rate by Department
- Number of Employees by Age Group - Shows the distribution of Employees by Age group
- Attrition By Education field - Shows the level of attrition within the various Educational fields. 
- Attrition Rate by Gender By Age Group - Compares the Attrition rate by gender for each age grouping.
  
### KPIs
- Employee count
- Attrition Count & Attrition Rate
- Number of Active Employees
- Average age of an Employee

 ### Results/Findings
During the exploration of the HR dataset, a significant focus was placed on understanding how attrition rates vary across different departments within the organization. Throuhg detailed analysis and visualization in Tableau, I have covered key insights that shed light on the dynamics of employee turnover by department. These insights not only highlight areas of concern but also offer a foundation for targeted intervention strategies. 

Based on the analysis of a this HR dataset, here's a summarized overview of insights and findings across the specified topics:

**1. Attrition by Department**
<u>High Attrition in Sales and R&D</u>:
The Sales and R&D departments were identified as having notably higher attrition rates compared to the HR department. This could be linked to job pressure and the competitive market for technical skills.

**2. Number of Employees by Age Group**
*Dominance of Mid-Career Employees*: 
The workforce primarily consists of mid-career employees, aged between 30 to 45, indicating a mature and experienced workforce.
Younger Employees' Growth: There's a smaller, but significant, segment of younger employees (20-30 years), pointing towards recent recruitment efforts or growth in entry-level positions.
Retention of Older Employees: Older employees (45+) represent a smaller proportion of the workforce, highlighting potential areas for improving retention or succession planning strategies.

**3. Job Satisfaction Ratings**
*Variable Satisfaction Across Departments:* Job satisfaction ratings vary significantly across departments, with higher satisfaction often found in departments with lower attrition rates.
Correlation with Attrition: Lower job satisfaction ratings correlate with higher attrition rates, emphasizing the importance of job satisfaction in employee retention strategies.
Impact of Recognition: Recognition and professional development opportunities are strongly associated with higher job satisfaction ratings, suggesting these as effective areas for intervention.

**4. Attrition by Education Field**
Higher Attrition in Certain Fields: Employees with backgrounds in Engineering and Sales are more likely to leave, possibly due to higher external job opportunities or job demands.
Lower Attrition in Specialized Fields: Conversely, fields such as Medicine and Science show lower attrition rates, which could reflect more specialized roles with fewer external opportunities or a higher degree of job satisfaction.

**5. Attrition Rate by Gender by Age**
*Gender Disparity in Younger Age Groups:* Younger male employees (20-30 years) have a slightly higher attrition rate compared to their female counterparts, which could be influenced by career progression opportunities or job market dynamics.
Convergence in Mid-Career: Attrition rates between genders tend to converge in the 30-45 age group, possibly reflecting stabilizing factors such as work-life balance priorities or job satisfaction.
Senior Age Group Variations: In the 45+ age group, attrition rates slightly diverge again, with female employees showing a bit higher retention than males, potentially due to different career lifecycle stages or organizational roles.

Conclusion
The analysis highlights key areas affecting employee dynamics within an organization, such as the impact of departmental structures, age demographics, job satisfaction, education fields, and the interplay between gender and age on attrition rates. These insights form a crucial foundation for targeted strategies aimed at enhancing job satisfaction, improving retention, and fostering a more inclusive and balanced work environment.




### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions


### Limitations
I had to change the data types of some numeric fields from text to numeric because they would have affected numeric calculations.
